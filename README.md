Android App to Control Phone Volume

This App lets you have the ability to automate your phones volume settings between off, vibrate of ring modes. There are two ways to create volume controls.

<b>Set Volume on Time Range</b><br>
Set up a repeating start and stop times, when the volume automatically changes on a particular day. For example, having a setting where Monday through Friday the volume turns off at 11 pm and turns back on at 8 am. This would to quite your phone overnight. Multiple settings of this type can be configured.

<b>Set Volume by Location</b><br>
Set up a repeating volume control based on location. Select a location from a map at your current location or search for a Place. Once selected, create a radius (Geofence in meters) around the location. When the user enters the location the volume will adjust to the settings provided. For example, if a volume contol was set up around a user's church, the volume could turn off when they are are at that location, then turn back on when leaving.<br>
